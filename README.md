- 👋 Hi, I’m @pkohler01. I moved from Hotmail to Yahoo Mail in 2001 only to learn that 'pkohler' was already taken so I added the 2-digit year. Here we are 20+ years later and I'm still adding '01' because 'pkohler' is always taken. Whoever you are, 'pkohler', darn you for beating me to it.
- 👀 I’m interested in business process management, lightweight efficiency tools, project management, and online advertising. I have over 45,000 hours in project management experience over the last ~25 years and have been primarily focused on adtech and martech since 2005.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of contemporary UX design to bring my understanding of that discipline up to date. While I have brought many products from ideation to market, I always felt that the UI work I executed especially for internal users has been functional but ghastly. By learning more about that, I'm hoping to find the patience to build lean and concise UIs in the future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on defining the best pizza dough recipe. No, seriously, it's like every major recipe with immensely positive reviews in my Google search results is bland and tasteless. What are the missing ingredients (don't say 'love')?
- 📫 How to reach me: through LinkedIn. Or maybe not. I get high volume of messages through LinkedIn every week and find it a bit overwhelming and am basically at the point where I ignore them so maybe that's not the best method for contacting me. Maybe email, at relhok.pilihp@gmail.com?
